Game Details:

The rules of the game are simple:
There are preplaced markers in space. 
If your ship gets in range of one of the markers (codenamed MINE), The MINE is yours until another ship gets in range. 
If more than one ship is in range, nobody owns the MINE until only one ship is in range again. 
Every predetermined period, a point is added for each mine a ship owns. 

After a predetermined time, the game ends and the ship with the most points wins. 
In order to achieve victory, your ship has been outfitted with a set of gadgets. 
Your ship has a thruster. This thruster can be pointed in any direction, and can be fed any amount of fuel up to a maximum. The laws of physics do apply so any object in motion will remain in motion. There is also a slight amount of kinetic friction. A pilotâ€™s manual on steering has been attached to this document. 
Your ship is also equipped with brakes.  
Your ship has two sensors: 
One sensor will scan the immediate area around the ship and return the coordinates of all the objects in range.
The other sensor will return all the objects in range of any position in the world. This sensor needs to be charged to use and therefore has a lengthy cool down. 
Your ship has also been equipped with a bomb factory and the ability to place bombs. Due to the weight of bombs, your ship can only be manufacturing/carrying one bomb at a time. 
You can place a bomb anywhere in a range. The bomb will explode after a certain time, and push away any ships in the area including yours. The closer the ship is to the center of the explosion, the more it will be pushed away.
